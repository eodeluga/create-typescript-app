# Create TypeScript App
## TypeScript quickstart template for VS Code
#### (because I found it really cumbersome to get TS tooling working from scratch at least with a WSL environment)

## To use
* npm install
* npm run build
* npm start

#### Entry point file is ./src/app.ts

#### **Note**: You may want to edit the package.json if you want to target specific versions of the dependencies (especially for production).
